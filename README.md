# ChessVision
Computer Vision project for my ECE 491 Class! Can detect, with 97% accuarcy, the pieces on the board of an image at any rotation.

Electronic sensors are too expensive. Manual moderation requires too many people at too many matches. This paper proposes a computer vision project tackling chess to detect pieces are for keeping track of many games in a tournament. With the use of preprocessing to create a giant dataset a model was trained to recognize piece by piece with 97% accuracy. The main problem is porting this to real-time playing standards and lies in the future results of working on better chess board corner detection.
